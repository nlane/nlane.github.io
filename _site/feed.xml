&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;post-meta&quot;&gt;Posted: Nov 18, 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;We need to start thinking about how we value software in order to drive the industry towards higher quality products.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proof:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Double Standard&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently was browsing the app store on my phone and reading some reviews on a few apps before hitting that “download” button. Scrolling through, I read one review from an individual that enjoyed the game but felt it was ruined by the “greedy developers” who put too many ads within the game. Now I too get annoyed as being bombarded with ads does damper the user experience. Have you ever gone to a news site to read an article but you can hardly see the text because most of the screen is covered in ads? Sometime even a video pops up OVER the text. Those websites are almost impossible to use!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing that gave me pause though when I read that review. How expensive was the phone the person downloaded and reviewed the game on? Now, I’ll admit that there is a market for phones under $500, but most smartphones these days cost much more. How many times have you heard someone joke that the X in iPhone X stands for expensive? I’ve heard it at least X times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you do dish out the $1,000 to get the new iPhone. If you want to use your traditional style headphones with it, you have to shake the piggy bank for an extra $9 to get the headphone jack adapter. Why isn’t that just included in the price for the phone? Take a second to imagine the outrage that would occur if Apple didn’t include the messages app with their phone. If you had to pay $3 to download it, I’m sure criticism would escalate beyond the review section of the app store. I find it really hard to believe, however, that Apple puts more money into that adapter than they do into the messages app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;comic-contain&quot;&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;via xkcd&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a double standard when it comes to software and hardware - and it makes sense. Sure I’ll dish out extra cash for the device which I can see and hold. Of course it costs so much with all the chips and circuits inside. That app on my phone? That news website? There are so many of those it can’t be that hard to make. Why should I pay for an application when there is almost always a free alternative?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to an art school growing up so I’ve always valued art in all its forms. While I haven’t personally paid hundreds of dollars for an original painting by a “starving artist”, I am careful to credit photos, pay for music, and dish out extra cash to rent a movie instead of illegally downloading it online. I consume art and want it to continue to be available at a quality level. Yes Beyoncé, take my $20 so you can make me another album as iconic as Lemonade. Software is similar in that we are so used to it, we’ve become desensitized to its value. Most of us will agree that if someone took the time to make it, and there are people consuming it, then it should be worth something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nothing in Life Comes Free&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one key difference between art and software though. Art can be made once and put out into the universe where it lives on for years. Software degrades at the speed of which technology updates, forcing developers to fix the breaks as they come more and more rapidly. If we are looking at software that makes money by charging its users (not through ads or other means), the next question is if a one-time fee covers the cost of the maintenance it takes to keep the software alive and relevant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photoshop used to be a one time payment. In fact, way back in the day, you would have to go to the store and buy a CD set for your computer. If you wanted the next version you would go out to the store and buy the next CD set. Today Adobe offers their products as part of a “Creative Cloud” which you can pay for either monthly or annually as a subscription. The software comes as a download rather than a CD which makes it simpler to pull updates as they occur. Adobe needs to keep up with changing technology both on the photography/graphic side as well as the personal computer side. As 3D printing grew more popular, Photoshop began to support 3D modeling. When Apple released laptops with touch bars, Adobe had to integrate this new interface into their products as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about products that are free? They say if you’re not paying for the product, then you are the product. We know that many big tech companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc) are selling your data or selling the fact that they have your data and can target ads to you. Rarely will you find free software that comes without any stipulations. That’s because it takes time to design, develop, and maintain quality software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As technology becomes a bigger and bigger part of our daily lives, we have to consider how we want to pay for the software we use. Are we okay with using free products that collect our data in the background for targeting ads? Would we rather pay to get the software that promises data privacy and doesn’t shove ads in your face? And is it worth it to keep paying for newer versions of that software? Or would we rather have a bunch of subscriptions for all our software which covers future updates? Obviously it will have to depend on the applications you are looking to invest in. If you’re a graphic artist, then yes the subscription to Photoshop is worth it. If you are looking to download a to-do list on your phone, you would be crazy to spend more than a couple dollars. Whatever you choose is fine, just make sure you are considering your options and not discounting the value of software simply because there is so much of it out there that appears free. If we treat software with the respect it deserves, the industry will continue to push towards high quality applications. Otherwise, we risk running into an age where the market is dominated by products that are poor quality or are making their money in questionable ways.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;post-meta&quot;&gt;Posted: Nov 08, 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;Imposter syndrome is normal, especially in technology. But you can overcome it!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proof:
Each night before you go to bed write down three things you did well that day. Try it for a month. Try it for a week. I don’t care - just try it. Admittedly, I do not do this daily. Someone gave me this advice years ago and I find myself going through phases with this exercise. It helps me most when I’m having low self-esteem and need a boost of confidence. In other words, it helps me when I feel like my imposter syndrome is returning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A popular term these days, imposter syndrome is a feeling of inadequacy despite evidence of success. You fear being exposed as an “imposter” as you attribute your accomplishments to luck. It is very common and not unique to being in the field of technology. That being said, I believe that being in the field of technology can make these feelings more prominent and longer term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;comic-contain&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/impostor_syndrome.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;via xkcd&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ask any software developer, they will tell you that a good portion of their day is spent looking at online resources. It’s not because they are bad at their jobs, it’s because technology is constantly evolving and no one can keep up. Most developers use multiple languages and libraries throughout their career. Even if you tend to use the same tools, updates within those tools force you to relearn them as you go. This is why half of a developers time could be spent learning and problem solving rather than actively writing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is that if you’re comfortable then you’re likely falling behind. You need to push yourself to learn new technologies in order to keep up, and you need to push even further if you want to get ahead. This is absolutely daunting. This perception of feeling behind can easily foster a sense of incompetency as you are aware of this whole world of knowledge you don’t have. Even as you keep chasing it by learning new things, that finish line keeps moving further and further away. Sure I had success yesterday, but is that relevant today? Of course it is, but you don’t always embody that truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So write it down. Note your accomplishments and feel good that you were able to learn something new. Even if the particular skill is obsolete tomorrow, you likely got much more out of the learning experience than just that skill. Learn to get comfortable with being uncomfortable, and do not be afraid to talk about your self-doubts. There wouldn’t be a Wikipedia page talking about “imposter syndrome” if it was not a real and common phenomenon.

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;A greater focus on computer science in K-12 schools will lead to increased diversity in technology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proof:
I still clearly remember my first day of computer science in college. I had not programmed prior to this class, however I entered with a cautious optimism as I knew I tended to do well with math and logic. But then the class began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My peers started raising their hands confidently asking about if we would be using Java or Python. After class they told stories of how they coded their calculators in middle school math because they were bored. I realized that I had falsely assumed that most of the students in this &lt;i&gt;introductory&lt;/i&gt; class would be beginners like me. I felt such envy that they were able to take AP computer science in high school. If only I had been given that chance, maybe I would not have to work twice as hard just to catch up? Only after a few weeks in the course, I found myself wanting to give up. But as the saying goes, my mama did not raise a quitter. So I fought through it and found out, once I got over the learning curve, that I was pretty good at computer science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, and I am still thinking about the series of events in ones life that may lead them to sit down in a computer science college class, try an online coding course, or sign up for one of the many bootcamps offered these days. While it is quite obvious that the computer science field is composed of mostly white males, it is less obvious how we can change that. I believe that programming will remain a niche field only pursued by a mostly privileged group of students and professionals until we integrate computer science into the K-12 curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By exposing younger children to programming you can prevent them from inheriting the negative stigmas often associated with computer science. When television shows and movies portray tech clubs or hackers they tend to paint an unattractive picture of “geeky” people (mostly men) with an unhealthy obsession for technology. Why not show children that computers and technology are for everyone? Allow their interest to develop before they build unhealthy and untrue biases. I think this point is especially relevant for solving the gender gap, but it’s best that I save my thoughts on that for another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting point is that some students may not have the resources to explore technology on their own. It is wrong to assume that every child is growing up with technology at their fingertips these days. &lt;a class=&quot;link-inside-post&quot; href=&quot;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/10/26/nearly-one-in-five-teens-cant-always-finish-their-homework-because-of-the-digital-divide/&quot;&gt;A recent study&lt;/a&gt;  by Pew Research showed that 25% of lower-income teenagers do not have access to a computer at home. If public schools fail to offer computer science classes, these students without computers have little to no chance of stumbling into the field on their own. The great thing about computer science is that you don’t need a computer to learn the foundational concepts. So even for schools that cannot afford laptops and for students who cannot afford an at-home computer, valuable computer science and algorithmic concepts can still be taught and practiced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About one year ago, Delaware’s Governor John Carney signed &lt;a class=&quot;link-inside-post&quot; href=&quot;http://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail?LegislationId=25346&quot;&gt;a bill&lt;/a&gt; which requires public high schools in the state to offer at least one computer science course by the 2020 school year. While we may be years away from conducting real studies which can confirm the long-term effects of bills such as this one, we can enjoy observing the start of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that adding a computer science class to public schools is not the complete solution, but it is a step in the right direction. The diversity problem in technology is not going to fix itself, and now is the time to start making changes. You hear everywhere that “technology is the future”. If this is true, then isn’t it better to let everyone have the opportunity to build our tomorrow?
