          <h1>Paying for Software</h1>
<p><span class="post-meta">Posted: Nov 18, 2018</span></p>
<h3><i>We need to start thinking about how we value software in order to drive the industry towards higher quality products.</i></h3>

<p>Proof:</p>

<p><i>Double Standard</i></p>

<p>I recently was browsing the app store on my phone and reading some reviews on a few apps before hitting that “download” button. Scrolling through, I read one review from an individual that enjoyed the game but felt it was ruined by the “greedy developers” who put too many ads within the game. Now I too get annoyed as being bombarded with ads does damper the user experience. Have you ever gone to a news site to read an article but you can hardly see the text because most of the screen is covered in ads? Sometime even a video pops up OVER the text. Those websites are almost impossible to use!</p>

<p>Here’s the thing that gave me pause though when I read that review. How expensive was the phone the person downloaded and reviewed the game on? Now, I’ll admit that there is a market for phones under $500, but most smartphones these days cost much more. How many times have you heard someone joke that the X in iPhone X stands for expensive? I’ve heard it at least X times.</p>

<p>Let’s say you do dish out the $1,000 to get the new iPhone. If you want to use your traditional style headphones with it, you have to shake the piggy bank for an extra $9 to get the headphone jack adapter. Why isn’t that just included in the price for the phone? Take a second to imagine the outrage that would occur if Apple didn’t include the messages app with their phone. If you had to pay $3 to download it, I’m sure criticism would escalate beyond the review section of the app store. I find it really hard to believe, however, that Apple puts more money into that adapter than they do into the messages app.</p>

<p>We have a double standard when it comes to software and hardware - and it makes sense. Sure I’ll dish out extra cash for the device which I can see and hold. Of course it costs so much with all the chips and circuits inside. That app on my phone? That news website? There are so many of those it can’t be that hard to make. Why should I pay for an application when there is almost always a free alternative?</p>

<p>I went to an art school growing up so I’ve always valued art in all its forms. While I haven’t personally paid hundreds of dollars for an original painting by a “starving artist”, I am careful to credit photos, pay for music, and dish out extra cash to rent a movie instead of illegally downloading it online. I consume art and want it to continue to be available at a quality level. Yes Beyoncé, take my $20 so you can make me another album as iconic as Lemonade. Software is similar in that we are so used to it, we’ve become desensitized to its value. Most of us will agree that if someone took the time to make it, and there are people consuming it, then it should be worth something.</p>

<p><i>Nothing in Life Comes Free</i></p>

<p>There’s one key difference between art and software though. Art can be made once and put out into the universe where it lives on for years. Software degrades at the speed of which technology updates, forcing developers to fix the breaks as they come more and more rapidly. If we are looking at software that makes money by charging its users (not through ads or other means), the next question is if a one-time fee covers the cost of the maintenance it takes to keep the software alive and relevant?</p>

<p>Photoshop used to be a one time payment. In fact, way back in the day, you would have to go to the store and buy a CD set for your computer. If you wanted the next version you would go out to the store and buy the next CD set. Today Adobe offers their products as part of a “Creative Cloud” which you can pay for either monthly or annually as a subscription. The software comes as a download rather than a CD which makes it simpler to pull updates as they occur. Adobe needs to keep up with changing technology both on the photography/graphic side as well as the personal computer side. As 3D printing grew more popular, Photoshop began to support 3D modeling. When Apple released laptops with touch bars, Adobe had to integrate this new interface into their products as well.</p>

<p>What about products that are free? They say if you’re not paying for the product, then you are the product. We know that many big tech companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc) are selling your data or selling the fact that they have your data and can target ads to you. Rarely will you find free software that comes without any stipulations. That’s because it takes time to design, develop, and maintain quality software.</p>

<p>As technology becomes a bigger and bigger part of our daily lives, we have to consider how we want to pay for the software we use. Are we okay with using free products that collect our data in the background for targeting ads? Would we rather pay to get the software that promises data privacy and doesn’t shove ads in your face? And is it worth it to keep paying for newer versions of that software? Or would we rather have a bunch of subscriptions for all our software which covers future updates? Obviously it will have to depend on the applications you are looking to invest in. If you’re a graphic artist, then yes the subscription to Photoshop is worth it. If you are looking to download a to-do list on your phone, you would be crazy to spend more than a couple dollars. Whatever you choose is fine, just make sure you are considering your options and not discounting the value of software simply because there is so much of it out there that appears free. If we treat software with the respect it deserves, the industry will continue to push towards high quality applications. Otherwise, we risk running into an age where the market is dominated by products that are poor quality or are making their money in questionable ways. QED.</p>
