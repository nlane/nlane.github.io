    A little about me - I'm currently working in NYC as a developer, but I was born and raised in Delaware (the first state!). For my undergraduate, I attended the University of Delaware where I earned a Bachelor of Science in computer science and a minor in math. When I'm not coding or blogging, I enjoy dancing. <br><br>
    A little about my blog - <b>Natalie's Little Theorems</b> is a tech blog with a math twist. The name is a play off of <b>Fermat's Little Theorem</b> as I view each blog post as a proof of some idea in technology that I believe to be true. I hope you enjoy it!
