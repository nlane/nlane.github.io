<h3><i>Imposter syndrome is normal, especially in technology. But you can overcome it!</i></h3>

Proof:
Each night before you go to bed write down three things you did well that day. Try it for a month. Try it for a week. I don't care - just try it. Admittedly, I do not do this daily. Someone gave me this advice years ago and I find myself going through phases with this exercise. It helps me most when I'm having low self-esteem and need a boost of confidence. In other words, it helps me when I feel like my imposter syndrome is returning.

A popular term these days, imposter syndrome is a feeling of inadequacy despite evidence of success. You fear being exposed as an "imposter" as you attribute your accomplishments to luck. It is very common and not unique to being in the field of technology. That being said, I believe that being in the field of technology can make these feelings more prominent and longer term.

If you ask any software developer, they will tell you that a good portion of their day is spent looking at online resources. It's not because they are bad at their jobs, it's because technology is constantly evolving and no one can keep up. Most developers use multiple languages and libraries throughout their career. Even if you tend to use the same tools, updates within those tools force you to relearn them as you go. This is why half of a developers time could be spent learning and problem solving rather than actively writing code.

The truth is that if you're comfortable then you're likely falling behind. You need to push yourself to learn new technologies in order to keep up, and you need to push even further if you want to get ahead. This is absolutely daunting. This perception of feeling behind can easily foster a sense of incompetency as you are aware of this whole world of knowledge you don't have. Even as you keep chasing it by learning new things, that finish line keeps moving further and further away. Sure I had success yesterday, but is that relevant today? Of course it is, but you don't always embody that truth.

So write it down. Note your accomplishments and feel good that you were able to learn something new. Even if the particular skill is obsolete tomorrow, you likely got much more out of the learning experience than just that skill. Learn to get comfortable with being uncomfortable, and do not be afraid to talk about your self-doubts. There wouldn't be a Wikipedia page talking about "imposter syndrome" if it was not a real and common phenomenon. QED.
