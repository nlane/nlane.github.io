<h3><i>With new year's resolutions in mind, I am going to apply 5 programming principles to my life in order to live a better 2019.</i></h3>

Proof:
In the spirit of the new year, I feel the drive to make some goals and work on living a better 2019. Nowadays, I feel as if "new year's resolutions" have taken on a bad reputation. It is assumed that as January turns to February and we get bogged down with day-to-day life that the goals drift away from us. To be candid, my goal last year was to read a book a month. I was bored by my February book and never finished it, but felt too guilty to immediately switch to another. I think I only read about 4 books last year (yikes!). Will 2019 be any different? I sure hope so, but I think it will work only if I make my goals a part of my lifestyle rather than thinking about them as "new year's resolutions".

My post today is along the same vein: 5 life principles I've learned from programming to take into 2019. These are not concrete goals that you can measure and track (sorry years of public school teaching me about "SMART" goals...). In fact, I wouldn't call these goals at all, they are simply principles to try to apply to your life in any way you can. In my experience these types of goals are more achievable as you apply them to the current activities of your daily life instead of adding on an extra chore to do. Hopefully I'll be able to hold onto these resolutions longer than February this year!

Principle 1: Don't Repeat Yourself

The Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle is arguably one of the most cited principles in programming. It's quite self-explanatory, but in terms of coding means that you shouldn't write out similar code or logic more that once. By wrapping this code into something that can be reused you save time creating this logic only once, you only have one place to go to make changes, and your code is much easier to read and understand.

There are a lot of ways to apply this principle to your life: (1) if you find yourself having to repeat stories or details to friends who are not listening, maybe you should work on building better friendships. (2) Perhaps at work if you have to explain and re-explain your thoughts constantly, make an effort to state things clearly and concisely the first time so that people get it. (3) Instead of simply talking about your goals, go and work on them. (4) Don't make others repeat themselves, try to be an engaged listener. Maybe you have some other interpretations of DRY, that's fine too! The point here is, no one likes repeating themselves, so if you find that you are doing this (either by words or actions), you should take a closer look at what's going on.

Principle 2: No Premature Optimization

In programming, and in many other fields, we tend to strive to come up with the best answer first. Why waste your time building something sub-optimal when you can take some extra time now to come up with the final solution? Well this sounds great at first, but rarely is a problem so understandable that this is possible. While building a solution you learn new things about the problem that change your understanding making those premature optimizations obsolete. Therefore it is faster to try to solve the problem first then optimize later once you fully understand the problem and solution.

So if you have a new year's resolution to exercise more, don't come up with an arbitrary gym schedule that you think fits best into your life. Start working out various days and times of the week to experiment and find what is most sustainable in your lifestyle. While it seems optimal to go to the gym in the mornings before work or school, if you're not a morning person this just isn't going to work (I know, I've tried!).

If you try to optimize your goals now, you risk implementing them incorrectly. This kills motivation and is probably why most new year's resolutions fail. Take your time to find different "solutions" or ways of achieving your goals. You will find what works as your optimal solution and will have much better chances of success.

Principle 3: Single Responsibility

In technology, you can divide your code up into functions, modules, classes, etc. This provides for a nice design of a program which is easier to create, maintain, and understand. To implement this well, it's recommended to follow the single responsibility principle. That is, to allow each part of the code to do it's one job and nothing more.

I find that this can really relate to your work-family-home life balance. You play certain roles in these different aspects of life, yet sometimes feel that you must play them all at once. For example, if I am the one in my family who tends to mediate conflicts, I may feel like this is the role I ought to take on at work as well. Of course that's not true at all! Would you wash the dishes in the kitchen sink of your office when you didn't use any simply because you tend to wash dishes at home? I hope not...

I've observed that women especially may feel the need to be the caretakers of an office because they often provide emotional support at home. This can lead to major burnout which is why it's better to partition your roles evenly into your aspects of life. Of course, if it's part of your core personality to be the caretaker, planner, mediator, or whatever role you play then it's fine to take this into all parts of your life. I'm saying that if you find yourself performing duties from one part of your life in another just because you feel like you have to, you should stop!

Principle 4: Learn From Others

Don't reinvent the wheel! When you are coding there are many languages and libraries which have functionalities built into them that are meant to be used and reused by programmers. Common tasks shouldn't be re-implemented (remember DRY?), programmers should take them and build upon it. Similarly, the first step to solving any problem in coding is to search the web for it. Chances are, someone else had that problem and has some solution that can help!

While at surface-level this seems to be a cheesy principle, I think its value cannot be understated. Learn from others. Maybe you have friends you can go to for advice, or maybe you can simply turn to the internet or a support group to talk about your problems. Join a club, play a new team sport, make a new friend, go to an improv class, whatever you do will open you up to others. You'll probably be surprised by how much you learn from these experiences.

Principle 5: Refactor!

Purposefully placed last is the everlasting lesson of refactoring. It's assumed that your code is not going to be perfect the first time, so you ought to go back and fix the structure of it. You don't need to change the functionalities and behavior of your code, just the design of it.

Same thing applies to you. This is dangerously close to the phrase "never settle for who you are", which is an unhealthy motto to live by if you don't have a good sense of self-worth. But assuming that you are comfortable and confident with who you are, you ought to have a drive for improvement. The key behind refactoring though, is you are not changing who you are as the qualities of you stay the same. You're simply becoming a better version of you!

If it's possible, I think I've managed to make this principle more corny than the last... In any case, you know what I mean!

Whether you're in technology or not, I hope these principles hit home for you. I wish you all luck with your new year's resolutions, goals, principles, or whatever you have set for yourself in 2019! QED.
