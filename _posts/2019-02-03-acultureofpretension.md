<h3><i>Why does a culture of pretension exist, and what are the consequences?</i></h3>

Proof:

We've all been there. Face-to-face with someone who *thinks* they are better than you and wants you to know it. This must happen in every industry, as there is always someone trying to assert dominance over others to stay at the top of their field. More and more, however, I am noticing how often this happens in the STEM world, specifically in computer science.

It's quite easy to sound smarter than you actually are in programming. With so many technologies, languages, versions, and concepts it is impossible to know everything. By name-dropping some of these new and unknown topics you can easily fool others into believing you know a lot more than them. Similarly it's easy to put others down for not knowing more. Perhaps you are an expert at iOS development, but know nothing about Android. If you try calling yourself a mobile development expert there will always be one person to call you out for not knowing Android.

I think I first noticed this phenomenon in college when I was discussing my course-load with peers from the engineering college. It seemed as if everyone felt the need to one-up each other. If I had 17 credits of classes, someone else had 20. If I had three exams next week, someone else had three exams AND two papers. We all were guilty of playing this game of "whose life is harder" in the world of academia.

I can only guess as to the reasons why people do this. Most likely, it comes from a place of insecurity. The better you are at programming (and probably other fields as well), the more aware you are of the depth of knowledge you lack. This is unsettling. What makes this thought more comfortable, is thinking that others also lack this knowledge. Thus people are tempted to bring others down simply to make themselves feel better. We all have varying levels of empathy, and those of us who are less empathic may not be aware how their comments are being perceived. I don't want to believe that anyone is purposely trying to make others feel bad about themselves. I believe they are making these comments to assure themselves of their own value, unaware of how this is affecting the other person. Again, this is just a guess. Perhaps I need to read a book or two on behavioral psychology to know for sure!

I'm less interested in why this happens and more interested on its consequences. Very early in my computer science career, I was often tempted to quit. As someone who went into college knowing zero programming I always felt behind. While I definitely found supportive peers who wanted to help me learn, there were others who continued to flaunt their knowledge. On the days where I wanted to quit, I was thinking about those students who knew so much more than me. I thought I would never make it to their level and it was not worth trying. It was their pretentious behavior that generated a toxic and isolating environment that was pushing me away. Thankfully, those supportive peers and teachers of mine convinced me to stay!

This pretentious culture affects everyone, not just beginners of a field. I will say however, that I believe it has a great effect on underrepresented groups. I cannot speak for the experience of others, but when faced with someone who is pretentious in technology I cannot help but ask myself "are they talking down to me because I am a woman?". Usually I like to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I can't help but think it's all somehow related. I find myself then trying to talk myself up, risking sounding pretentious myself, just to show them that I can fit in. What a vicious cycle!

If you think about it rationally, it is a good idea to get more people interested and experienced in your field. The more support it has, the stronger it gets. A good programming-related example is open-source software. This software tends to be better as it has been developed by a bunch of different people and the support community is large. It is important to note that numbers are just as powerful here as diversity. Imagine if an open-source software was only developed by people at one company. These developers are all thinking about the software through tunnel vision. You need people with other experiences and motives to make your software more dynamic and robust.

So what should we do about it? I would suggest to do what I'm trying to do more of: paying attention! Try to practice empathy and find ways to build your own confidence without putting others down. I think we can all agree that a supportive and inclusive culture is stronger than a competitive and toxic one. So why continue to enable this culture of pretension? Just listen to Ellen Degeneres and simply "be kind to one another". QED.
